You use Claude for some things, ChatGPT for others, Cursor for code. But your context — your projects, decisions, preferences — doesn’t move with you. You re-explain yourself constantly.

Second Brain fixes that. One shared memory, available in every AI tool you use.

And unlike the built-in memory inside any single app, this one is yours. It lives in your own account. No platform controls it, and no platform can take it away.

## How it works

Connect Second Brain to whichever AI tools you use. Then tell it things once. It finds them later by meaning, so asking “what did I decide about the pricing model?” surfaces the right note even if you never used those exact words when you saved it.

|Tool         |What it does                                                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|`remember`   |Store anything: ideas, decisions, project context           |
|`append`     |Add updates to an existing entry without creating duplicates|
|`update`     |Replace an entry's content entirely                         |
|`recall`     |Finds memories by meaning, not exact wording                |
|`list_recent`|Browse recent memories by date                              |
|`forget`     |Delete an entry                                             |

## Save from anywhere

Memory is only useful if it actually gets filled. Second Brain connects to the tools and moments where context naturally lives.

- **CLI** -- `brain remember`, `brain recall`, and more from your terminal — `npm install -g second-brain-cf-cli`
- **Obsidian** -- notes sync automatically via the [community plugin](https://github.com/rahilp/second-brain-obsidian-plugin)
- **iOS** -- Brain Dump, Text Brain Dump, and Save to Brain shortcuts in one tap
- **Browser extension** -- capture any page or highlighted text in one click via the [Chrome extension](https://github.com/rahilp/second-brain-browser-extension)
- **Any AI client** -- use `remember` mid-conversation, right when something matters

## Setup

> **Before you deploy:** You’ll be asked to set an `AUTH_TOKEN`. This is the password your AI clients use to connect.
> 
> **Quick option:** Use a memorable phrase like `coffee-lover-2026`
> 
> **Secure option:** Run `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal and paste the result
> 
> **Save it.** You’ll need it in the next step.

1. **Click Deploy** — everything provisions automatically
1. **Set your token** — you’ll be prompted during deploy
1. **Connect your AI tools** — [instructions here](../../wiki/Connect-to-AI-Clients)

That’s it. Your memory is live and ready across every tool you connect.

```bash
# Verify it's working (replace with your worker URL and token)
curl -X POST https://<your-worker-url>/capture \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer coffee-lover-2026" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "second brain is working", "source": "test"}'
# → {"ok":true,"id":"..."}
```
